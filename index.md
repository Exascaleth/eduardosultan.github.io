**Changetheblock**

**[Influapp](http://www.influapp.es)** ‚Üí **Tokenomics Designer and Writer**. 

Designed Influapp's tokenomics. 

The supply-side strategies include an 18% initial release with an adjustable 8% inflation rate. Time-based vesting schedule, 6-month cliff for investors and team, 5-year linear vests with 6-month gaps between unlocks. Liquidity tactic: normal incentivized liquidity transitioning into liquidity bonding as the ecosystem evolves. The exact initial distribution and inflation allocation of $INFL tokens cannot be disclosed yet.

Strategies implemented on the Demand side: 
- Utility ‚Üí holders can pay or swap $INFL tokens for goods and services
- Usage rewards ‚Üí both users and merchants will receive $INFL-based incentives for using and promoting the app  
- Hodling ‚Üí the more significant the $INFL balance, the higher the cashback reward and the lower the time to claim rewards 
- Staking ‚Üí considering that Influapp will charge transaction fees, $INFL stakers will receive 30% of the protocol's collected fees in the form of real yield and another % out of the 8% yearly inflation (cannot be disclosed yet)
- Buybacks ‚Üí While the inflation rate remains at 8%, 20% of transaction fees will be bought back and sent to the stability vault that will act as a steward for $INFL's price action stabilizer - buying and selling $INFL onto the market to guarantee stability and steady growth 
- Burning ‚Üí 5% of transaction fees will be burned out of circulation up until 15% of the max supply is burned

Enacted the client's whitepaper (still in progress).


**[Cloumize](https://cloumize.com)** ‚Üí **Project Manager**. 

Managed and Led a team of 4 developers in Cloumize's front and back-end infrastructure development. 

Among the Epics: 
- API skeleton (repo creation, server config, development of middleware)
- AUTH APIs (routes, models, and microservices), Auth/user endpoints, Auth page
- Front-end skeleton, Landing view, Profile view, Error view
- Payment endpoints
- Connect API with Cloumize's database 

The project was completed six days ahead of schedule. Used a Jira kanban board as the focal point of the project. 

**[Winbase](https://winbase.io)** ‚Üí **Business Strategy, Token Design, and Writer**. 

Led the business strategy ideation and implementation phase with the client's Product Owner; designed the demand side of the $WIN token economics; enacted the V1 of its Litepaper. 

- Business Strategy: Developed a staggered utility structure for its membership NFTs, wherein rarity and evolution ‚Äî based on involvement and engagement ‚Äîunlock new benefits for NFT holders. Additionally, non-transferable NFT wrappers - motivated by the wrap N zap functions of DAO-haus - were developed, which would unlock $WIN token benefits for users who adopt leadership roles within the communities of each celebrity or brand. 

- $WIN Token Design: once introduced, the $WIN token will be the native currency of the whole Winbase ecosystem. It will allow users to buy NFTs, invest on the platform's launchpad, and participate in decision-making processes (aka governance) of subDAOs they are members of. Again, the $WIN token will count with staking and buyback mechanisms to control volatility in the initial phases. 

The token's private sale is expected to take place in Q1 2023. 

**[Universidad de √Åvila - Master en Dise√±o Blockchain](https://www.ucavila.es/formacion/estudios-propios/diseno-desarrollo-blockchain/)** ‚Üí **Professor?** ü§†.
I imparted the tokenomics module, where I presented all things tokenomics, from the supply, demand, gaming theory, and token dynamics down to veTokenomics, time-based tokenomics, and bonding curves. 

**0xCrypto DAO**

**Governance and Voting System:** 

Designed 0xCrypto's governance and voting system, introducing a new concept of governance for Venture DAOs called "Soulbound Score." This governance and weighted voting model comprises three variables determining the weight of each DAO member's voting power. The three variables will be NFT Type and investments carried out within the DAO (economic variable), active participation (participation variable), and Time as a member (time variable); the last two variables vary per a predefined decay rate. 

A natural logarithm decreasing curve formula is used to determine the percentage weight of each member. In this way, a cap on the "Scores" of each variable is applied, making it impossible to form "whales" that have a disproportionate power within the DAO. The Soulbound Score allows the DAO to establish equitable, anti-capture, and bribery mechanisms aligned with its objectives.

**Working Whitepaper:** Enacted the first version of 0xCrypto's working Whitepaper which was approved with a 97% approval rate.

**[Showkarma.xyz](https://www.showkarma.xyz/)** ‚ÜíBuilt the reputation points system for 0xCrypto DAO and successfully integrated Showkarma's solution onto the DAO's Discord server and Snapshot. Still working on the integration with Discourse, Dework, and Coordinape. 

[SuperDAO ](https://app.superdao.co/0xcrypto-dao-es/members) ‚Üí created and onboarded 0xCrypto's SuperDAO smart contract framework. 

**Building a DAO sessions**: moderated 8 AMAs and 3 panels with no less than 12 members per session to discuss about the DAO's governance and go-to-market strategy. 

## My Token Evalutation Framework


```markdown

Disclaimer: This framework combines questions and metrics from several of the brightest minds in the ecosystem; I do not take full credit for it. 

Putting aside all the essential MarketCap, Circ. Supply, Max Supply, FDV, liquidity depth, and token launch indicators...
these are the questions I ask myself when analyzing Tokenomics: 

Supply

1. Where is the supply right now?
2. Where will it be in the future?
3. When will it be there?
4. How will it get there?

From here, the following subsequent questions arise:
- What factors affect the token's selling pressure?
- Time-based or trigger-based vesting schedule? Linear vests or date-specific vests? Cliff length?
- Who do emissions go to? What % of supply do the top 10 addresses control? 
- Do emissions generate profits or protect stakeholders against dilution? Can token holders benefit from emissions by staking or LPing? 
- What will happen when locked (or staked) tokens are released? Bulk lockups? 

Demand

1. What are the key drivers of demand for the token? Why would anyone buy the token ‚Üí Buying Point
2. How strong is its unique value proposition? 
3. Risk substitution? Competitors? How strong is the general market's appetite to use its product or service? 
4. Is there a game theory-driven incentive to hold the token? Is there a token lockup mechanism? 
5. Does the project buyback and/or burn its tokens? 
6. Chills of Ponzinomics? 
7. Vibrant community? 

Token Utility 

1. Is the token supposed to be held as an investment? Or is it supposed to be spent to pay for a service or product?
2. Token model ‚Üí Is it a Governance, Productive (staking/cash flow - real yield-generating token), or veToken? 
3. If Governance, how concentrated are governance votes? What are the minimum token requirements to submit and escalate a governance proposal?
Can Governance enable or affect profit distribution? 
4. If Productive, how are cash flows being generated? What percentage of a project's cash flows are distributed to token holders? 
Are cash flows dilutive or redistributive?
5. Can the token be used as collateral? 

Financially oriented metrics

1. P/E = Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) / Protocol yearly earnings
2. Price / DisFees = Fully Diluted Valuation / Yearly distributed fees
3. Correlation with the broader crypto market? 
4. How has the token held up against USD or ETH/BTC since its inception?
5. Have emissions/staking earnings offset any of the losses?

Business oriented metrics

1. How will the protocol offset the cold start problem? What strategies to incentivize initial utility and liquidity will be implemented? 
2. Do they plan to launch vampire attacks on users of other applications? Progressive airdrops? 
3. How will the protocol avoid token outflows? How will it incentivize token inflows? How will the protocol foster token flow within the ecosystem? 
4. Does it require active or passive participation from tokenholders? 

This set of questions provides the basis for a more in-depth tokenomics analysis.

**Chains and Protocols I frequently interact with:**
- ETH L1, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Gnosis Chain, BSC, Chainlink, The Graph, and Celo; Uniswap, Aave, Balancer, Maple Finance, Accross Bridge, Mirror.xyz, among maaaany others.  

**Tools that make my web3 journey more exciting:** 
- Nansen.ai, Token Unlocks, EthDrops, Dune Analytics, Messari Governor, DeFiLlama, Dove Metrics, Ora, Slurpxbt's Datafeed, Stratupy.world

**My mantra in DAO Governance?** Governance should not be considered as a utility but a service for which a DAO/protocol pays for.
